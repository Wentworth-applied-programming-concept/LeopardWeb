# LeopardWeb

## Description

Our Leopard web has a login/logout interface that allows users to login using their username (email in database from Assignment 3) and a password 
(Admin: **pass123** – Student: **pass1235** – Instructor: **pass1234**).  
The system can recognize whether that username belongs to an administrator, student or instructor and match it with one the previously mentioned password. 
You will get an error if username is not in database or password doesn’t match user type.
